# SimuBargain: Negotiation Simulation & Scenario Modeling  

SimuBargain is a negotiation simulator that models contract proposals, costs, and outcomes under different wage and benefit scenarios. Using Monte Carlo simulations and regression models, it equips labor strategists, HR leaders, and compliance auditors with actionable insights to optimize decision-making and predict negotiation results.

## Overview
SimuBargain combines historical financial data, labor statistics, and predictive modeling to simulate labor negotiations and contract outcomes. Built with Python, R, NumPy, SimPy, Jupyter, and Plotly, it allows users to test “what-if” scenarios, visualize potential results, and make data-driven negotiation decisions.

## Why Use SimuBargain
SimuBargain simplifies complex negotiation processes:

<ol><b>Risk Assessment:</b> Quantify potential risks and rewards of contract proposals before negotiations.</ol>
<ol><b>Data-Driven Decisions:</b> Base bargaining strategies on simulations and predictive models rather than intuition.</ol>
<ol><b>Efficiency:</b> Rapidly test multiple scenarios to identify optimal outcomes and strategies.</ol>
<ol><b>Visualization & Communication:</b> Present results clearly to stakeholders for informed decision-making.</ol>

## Target Users
<b>HR Teams:</b> Forecast the impact of contracts on payroll, benefits, and workforce productivity.  

<b>Union Representatives:</b> Simulate negotiation scenarios to evaluate leverage and outcomes.  

<b>Compliance Auditors:</b> Assess potential compliance risks and ensure proposals meet regulations.  

<b>Data Analysts & Economists:</b> Apply modeling techniques to simulate labor market and financial impacts.

## How It Works
<ol><b>Data Input:</b> Import financial records, labor statistics, and historical contract data.</ol>
<ol><b>Scenario Setup:</b> Define variables like wages, benefits, working hours, and contract terms.</ol>
<ol><b>Simulation:</b> Run Monte Carlo simulations and regression analyses to generate potential outcomes.</ol>
<ol><b>Visualization:</b> Display results using interactive dashboards and plots for analysis.</ol>
<ol><b>Decision Support:</b> Use outputs to guide negotiation strategies and evaluate best-case/worst-case scenarios.</ol>

## Use Cases
<ol><b>Labor Negotiations:</b> Model contract proposals to assess financial and operational impact.</ol>
<ol><b>Strategic Planning:</b> Evaluate “what-if” scenarios for workforce and compensation strategies.</ol>
<ol><b>Union Bargaining Prep:</b> Provide simulations and data-driven insights to strengthen negotiating positions.</ol>
<ol><b>Risk Analysis:</b> Quantify uncertainties and identify potential leverage points for stakeholders.</ol>

## Future Plans
<ol><b>Real-Time Data Integration:</b> Connect to live financial and HR systems for continuous scenario updates.</ol>
<ol><b>Advanced AI Models:</b> Incorporate machine learning for more accurate predictive modeling of negotiation outcomes.</ol>
<ol><b>Collaboration Features:</b> Enable multiple stakeholders to explore scenarios and insights interactively.</ol>
<ol><b>Cloud-Based Deployment:</b> Offer SimuBargain as a scalable SaaS platform for enterprise and labor organizations.</ol>
